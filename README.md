# ESP8266 Water Level Management System
This repository hosts the code for a water level management system tailored for the ESP8266 microcontroller. It's designed to monitor and control water levels in environments such as sump pits, water tanks, or irrigation systems, ensuring efficient and automated water management.

## Key Features
- **Automated Pump Control**: Engages the water pump based on predefined water level thresholds, time of day, etc.
- **Safety Measures**: Prevents the pump from running dry by deactivating it before the water level drops too low.
- **MQTT Integration**: Allows for remote monitoring and control, sending water level data and pump status to a specified MQTT broker.

## Design Decisions
- **Focused Flushing Logic**: Incorporates an active monitoring loop within `activatePump()`, ensuring water level safety during pump operation.
- **Simplicity**: Straightforward design for ease of maintenance and stability.

## Future Plans
- **Predictive Analysis of Weather Forecasts**: Before the clouds even decide to open up, our system will already be two steps ahead. By analyzing weather forecasts with the same intensity a trader analyzes the stock market, we'll predict when to activate the pump, ensuring preemptive action against any potential waterlogging. This feature is in development, pending our ability to negotiate data sharing terms with the weather itself.
- **Historical Pump Activation Data Mining**: They say history repeats itself, and who are we to argue? By meticulously studying the patterns of past pump activations, we aim to uncover the mystic rhythms of subterranean hydrodynamics. This deep dive into historical data will not only refine our activation protocols but might also accidentally advance the field of archaeology.
- **Astrological Water Level Management**: In the grand scheme of the cosmos, even sump pumps play a pivotal role. By integrating astrological data, our system will provide tailored water management solutions based on the alignment of stars and planets. Mercury in retrograde? Maybe it's a sign to double-check those pump connections. Full moon in Pisces? Waters might rise, but your pump will be ready and waiting.
